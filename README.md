# Heart Disease Risk Prediction
## What is this?
This is a multiple-cut Decision Tree ID3 algorithm with pruning function to predic risk of heart disease by :
* Chest pain type
* Fasting blood sugar
* Resting electrocardiographic results
* Exercise induced angina
* The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* Thal
* Age
* Resting blood pressure
* Serum cholestoral
* Maximum heart rate achieved
* ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* number of major vessels colored by flourosopy

Result is presented in integer range in 0..4
